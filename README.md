# obfuscation-experiments
Final project for Veillance Spring 2019 ITP

This code was edited from Shawn Van Every's code here: https://github.com/vanevery/p5_axis_rekognition_example
I changed the camera from an external one to the computer's interal webcam, added a graphical interface in the html and updloaded new photos to work with.

The photos here are from the Labelled Faces in the Wild Dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/lfw-dataset I have redacted all personal and non-public photos.

    [1] Obfuscation is the deliberate addition of ambiguous, confusing, or
    misleading information to interfere with surveillance and data collection.<br />
    …<br />
    [2] Obfuscation, at its most abstract, is the production of noise modeled on
    an existing signal in order to make a collection of data more ambiguous,
    confusing, harder to exploit, more difficult to act on, and therefore less
    valuable (p.46)<br />

    <br />--Definitions from Obfuscation: A User’s Guide for Privacy and Protest
    by Finn Burton and Helen Nissenbaum<br />

    <br />This project is in response to recent developments in machine learning
    and the increasing ubiquitousness of facial recognition systems.
    These technologies have brought many benefits and conveniences, but we also
    we believe it is important to ask questions of the technological developments
    and and think critically before employing them. By making a kit of silicone
    face adhesives to make oneself anonymous to facial recognition systems we
    hope to give people a choice.<br />

    <br />We encourage you to read the Obfuscation User’s Guide which discusses
    important questions in this work such as: Is obfuscation necessary? Is
    obfuscation justified? Will obfuscation work?<br />

    <br />In particular, we are motivated by the following from this book:<br />

    <br />Importance of privacy: privacy is important because it allows us to
    develop and get to know ourselves as individuals<br />

    <br /><b>Information asymmetry:</b> this is about knowledge and power and happens
    when information about us is used and collected in ways we don’t
    understand<br />

    <br /><b>Data obedience:</b> Currently, many tech systems we engage with although
    portrayed as voluntary have no way of not participating. Like the economic
    man, the person with the perfect data security and privacy practices is does
    not exist<br />

    <br /><b>Ethics of obfuscation:</b>  This is an essential discussion - obfuscation
    tactics should have legitimate ends and should not cause harm and does not
    leave others worse off.<br />


    <br />Building on work in this area, this project aims not to obscure a
    person from a camera, but to render their face anonymous or unidentified.
    This project is an effort of initial research into how to create portable
    tools to protect against facial recognition software. In the next phase,
    we’d like to use machine learning to develop the. It will be impossible for
    us to continue to adapt our designs against<br />

    <h1>Technical</h1>
    This project uses Amazon’s facial recognition and classification software
    called Rekognition. This system is able to recognize faces that have been
    uploaded to it. The server is a node express server running on a
    DigitalOcean droplet.<br />

    <br />You can see the code on github here. You can read more about the
    process here.<br />
